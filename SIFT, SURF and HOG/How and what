                                                    SIFT
The major advantage of SIFT features, over edge features or hog features,
is that they are not affected by the size or orientation of the image.
What am I doing-

Constructing a Scale Space: To make sure that features are scale-independent
Scale space is a collection of images having different scales, generated from a single image.
The ideal number of octaves should be four, and for each octave, the number of blur images should be five.

DoG
Difference of Gaussian is a feature enhancement algorithm that involves the subtraction of one blurred version of 
an original image from another, less blurred version of the original.

To locate the local maxima and minima, we go through every pixel in the image and compare it with its neighboring pixels

Keypoint Localisation: Identifying the suitable features or keypoints
To locate the local maxima and minima, we go through every pixel in the image and compare it with its neighboring pixels.
Hence, we will eliminate the keypoints that have low contrast, or lie very close to the edge.


Orientation Assignment: Ensure the keypoints are rotation invariant
Keypoint Descriptor: Assign a unique fingerprint to each keypoint

                                                  HOG
                                                  
The HOG feature descriptor counts the occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.We need to 
preprocess the image and bring down the width to height ratio to 1:2. 
The image size should preferably be 64 x 128. 
This is because we will be dividing the image into 8*8 and 16*16 patches to extract the features.

By doing so, we get the features (or histogram) for the smaller patches which in turn represent the whole image.
We can certainly change this value here from 8 x 8 to 16 x 16 or 32 x 32.

If we divide the image into 8Ã—8 cells and generate the histograms, we will get a 9 x 1 matrix for each cell.
