## Welcome to my Computer Vision world!
I have worked with Computer Vision for crafting depth maps,Deep learning and so on! I am always looking at ways to apply the amazing powers of OpenCV! <br>
With OpenCV , the possibilities are endless! I have conquered the following: <br> 
- Detecting faces <br>
- Lane Detection
- Facial features (or counting eye blinks!)
- Making haarcascades
- Using OpenCV APIs for Object tracking
- Depth maps using Stereo algorithms [Not open sourced, kinda secret :) ] <br>
