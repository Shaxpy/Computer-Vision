# Image-processing
This is an Image processing code based on documentation of OpenCV.
I have started doing this as part of my Plan to integrate these techniques with DeepLearning Networks like CNN in future
for making an object detection Bot.
Basically, a surveillance system backed by Raspberry Pi 3b+
