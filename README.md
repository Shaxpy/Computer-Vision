# Image-processing
This is an Image processing repo based on documentation of OpenCV.
I am moving forward to my next phase i.e Computer Vision by means of SSD Mutlibox Object Detection
I have started doing this as part of my Plan to integrate these techniques with DeepLearning Networks like CNN in future
for making an object detection Bot.
Backed by Raspberry Pi 3b+ , the possibilities are limitless!
