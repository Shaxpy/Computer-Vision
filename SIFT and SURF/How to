Constructing a Scale Space: To make sure that features are scale-independent
Scale space is a collection of images having different scales, generated from a single image.
The ideal number of octaves should be four, and for each octave, the number of blur images should be five.

DoG
Difference of Gaussian is a feature enhancement algorithm that involves the subtraction of one blurred version of an original image from another, less blurred version of the original.

To locate the local maxima and minima, we go through every pixel in the image and compare it with its neighboring pixels

Keypoint Localisation: Identifying the suitable features or keypoints
To locate the local maxima and minima, we go through every pixel in the image and compare it with its neighboring pixels.
Hence, we will eliminate the keypoints that have low contrast, or lie very close to the edge.


Orientation Assignment: Ensure the keypoints are rotation invariant
Keypoint Descriptor: Assign a unique fingerprint to each keypoint
